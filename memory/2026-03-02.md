## Evening Proactive Work

### PP Ventures Improvements
- Updated Mission Control Leads page (`/leads`) to fetch real PP Ventures contact form submissions instead of demo data
- The contact form on ppventures.tech (port 8080) POSTs to `/api/ppventures-contact` which saves to `ppventures-contacts.json`
- Leads page now shows actual contacts with name, email, service interest, message, timestamp, and status

### Site Status
- PP Ventures static site: http://72.62.231.18:8080 (blog, contact form, services)
- Mission Control: http://72.62.231.18:3000 (dashboard with leads management)

### Notes
- Contact form API is working - saves submissions to JSON file
- Leads page needs rebuild/restart to pick up changes (done)
