## Decision

⚠️ ESCALATED TO NEO

**Reason:** Task is extremely vague with no clear context. 'Status flow' is ambiguous - could refer to project management status, application state transitions, workflow system, or any status update mechanism. No entities identified, no success criteria defined, and the specific system/component to test is unclear. Multiple agents (neo, scout) have already failed to complete this task due to insufficient information.
