## Decision

⚠️ ESCALATED TO NEO

**Reason:** Task is extremely vague with no clear context. 'Status flow' is ambiguous - could refer to project management status, application state transitions, workflow system, or any status update mechanism. No entities identified, no success criteria defined, and action type is unclear. Requires clarification on what system/component to test, what the expected status flow should be, and what success looks like.
