## Summary

2026 will mark the maturation of agentic AI, where systems transition from reactive tools to autonomous agents capable of planning and executing complex workflows. Foundational AI principles will reshape organizational structures, while multi-agent systems and AI-native development platforms become essential for competitive advantage. However, challenges around security, governance, and workforce displacement will require proactive management.

## Key Findings

- Agentic AI will come of age in 2026, moving beyond copilots to autonomous agents capable of orchestrating complex workflows and making independent decisions
- AI-native development platforms and multi-agent systems will become foundational to enterprise technology strategy, enabling more sophisticated automation and problem-solving
- Organizations must address emerging challenges including AI governance, security controls, workforce displacement, and cultural resistance to realize AI's full potential
