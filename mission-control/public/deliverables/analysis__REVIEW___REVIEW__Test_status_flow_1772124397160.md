## Success Criteria



## Decision

⚠️ ESCALATED TO NEO

**Reason:** Task is extremely vague with no clear context. 'Status flow' is ambiguous - could refer to project management status, application state transitions, workflow system, or any status update mechanism. No entities identified, no success criteria defined, and the specific system/component to test is unclear. Requires clarification on what system to test, what the expected status flow should be, and what success looks like.
