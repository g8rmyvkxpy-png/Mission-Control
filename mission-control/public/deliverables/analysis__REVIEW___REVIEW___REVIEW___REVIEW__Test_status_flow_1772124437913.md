## Success Criteria



## Decision

⚠️ ESCALATED TO NEO

**Reason:** Task is extremely ambiguous - 'status flow' could refer to project management status, application state transitions, workflow system, or any status update mechanism. No entities identified, no specific system/component to test, no success criteria defined, and action type is unclear. Multiple agents (neo, scout) have already failed to complete this task due to insufficient information. Requires clarification on: what system to test, what the expected status flow should be, what success looks like, and what testing approach is needed.
